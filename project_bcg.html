            <p>As an in-progress project, please keep in mind that NOTHING on this page is final. Everything is very much a work-in-progress, but if you would like to learn more, I would love to discuss what I've accomplished so far with you!</p>
            <p>This is a worker-placement game, inspired by games such as Lords of Waterdeep and the volunteer program at Cape Henlopen State Park. To define the game's direction, I came up with a short list of design objectives:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><em>Strategic:</em> Players should be given opportunities to make meaningful decisions that impact their standing in the game.</li>
              <li><em>Collaborative:</em> Even though players are competing against each other, everything should be about helping the park.</li>
              <li><em>Diplomatic:</em> Players should have opportunities to interact with each other, and be given reasons to both do so and not do so.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section class="two-col-grid-item">
            <h3>Short-term goals</h3>
            <p>Currently, the game is designed to acomodate 2-5 players. However, in a 2-player game, there is no incentive to complete tasks cooperatively, since doing so does not give you an advantage over your only opponent. To fix this, I need to change the co-op rewards to be asymetrical, which should also help increase the diplomatic aspects of the game for all player counts.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="two-col-grid-item">
            <h3>Long-term goals</h3>
            <p>I'm coordinating with Cape Henlopen State Park to understand what their vision for the game is, and how to make that vision align with my own. I would like this game to eventually be an official piece of Cape Henlopen merchandice, but working my way through the levels of government beurocracy necessary to do so will be challenging.</p>

            <p><em>What Went Well</em></p>
            <ul>
              <li><em>Pacing:</em> The puzzles all introduce the necessary elements at a good pace, so that players don't feel overwhelmed with a sudden deluge of mechincs they need to learn.</li>
              <li><em>Scope Management:</em> By carefully allocating my time, and limiting the number of features I added, I was able to complete the level well before the one-week deadline.</li>
              <li><em>Puzzle Skips:</em> Early iterations allowed some puzzles to be skipped, but I was able to catch these flaws and use the provided assets to modify the puzzles so that they must be completed to continue.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section class="three-col-grid-item">
            <p><em>What Went Wrong</em></p>
            <ul>
              <li><em>Linking Sliders:</em> When the sliders are introduced, I feel like I could have done a better job showing players what object(s) the sliders controlled. Players can figure out which objects are controlled by which sliders, but this should be made more obvious.</li>
              <li><em>Explaining the Weapon:</em> Similarly, once the player acquires the ability to fire projectiles, nothing explains to the player that they can now left click to do so. If players do not try to left click, they end up stuck in the weapn-unlock area, unable to progress.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section class="three-col-grid-item">
            <p><em>What to Improve</em></p>
            <ul>
              <li><em>Backtracking:</em> For newer players, the level layout could be a little confusing. Since players have to backtrack to the starting area, and repeatedly cross through the central intersection, there is an increased risk of newer players getting lost.</li>
              <li><em>Asthetics:</em> Each room is visually similar to the others, so changing up the appearance of each room could help players keep better track of which room they are in.</li>
            </ul>
