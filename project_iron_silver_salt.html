      <h1>Iron, Silver, and Salt</h1>
      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>There are currently over 900,000 podcasts available for listeners around the world. One way podcasts have distinguished themselves from the competition is by giving listeners a webpage to visit. Iron, Silver, and Salt is one such podcast that needed a home, and I was excited to design one for them.</p>

        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>Iron, Silver, and Salt is a monster hunting podcast that wants to expand their listener base. One way the hosts were looking to do so was by creating a website to direct listeners to. They weren’t sure what they wanted to include on their site however, and tasked me with not only designing their site, but also determining what content should appear on it.</p>
        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p>The solution was a virtual desktop, monster hunting journal on center-stage. Information about the hosts, monsters, and individual episodes all give users a better idea what the podcast is about. The information is all supported by a clear, consistent brand that helps convey the monster-hunting theme.</p>

      <h3>Competitive analysis</h3>
      <p>My first task was to analyze the competition. In the cloud storage space, Google Drive and Dropbox are the two biggest players, so I performed a SWOT analysis on these two. As the number one video hosting service, I also checked out YouTube. Each of these three had issues with their platform hower, that could allow for a site like Highlight to break into the market.</p>

      <h3>User Survey</h3>
      <p>The first step was discovering what users wanted to see when visiting a podcast’s website. Were potential listeners more interested in learning what others thought about the podcast, or learning more about the hosts? Did they want to listen to episodes on-site, or follow links to outside streaming sources? The answers came by putting out a survey, asking potential listeners directly what they wanted.</p>
      <img src="graphics/iss_survey_1.png" alt="Survey results" class="DiscoveryImage">
      <p>Once I had a better idea of the features users wanted to find in the site, I asked several people to participate in a card sort to help determine where users expected to find each feature.</p>

    <section id="IA_anchor" class="ISSIATop">
      <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
      <p>With the data gained from the survey, the SWOT analysis, and a few followup questions, I was able to create three user personas. These helped me to stay focused on the users’ wants throughout the design process.</p>

      <p>Information in hand, I created several user stories, ranking them based off of the data gained from earlier research. I also took input from Iron, Silver, and Salt into consideration, giving a little more weight to the features they wanted included in their site. This prioritization really helped me focus on the most important tasks- doubly important due to the very compressed timeline of this project.</p>

          <h3>Wireframes</h3>
          <p>With the user flows and card sort helping define the pages that would make up Iron, Silver, and Salt’s site, it was time to sketch out the wireframes. I sketched out several concepts, asking the hosts which idea they preferred. With their input, I sketched out the rest of the site, taking their continued feedback into consideration.</p>

      <h3>Branding</h3>
      <p>While working on the wireframes, I also worked with Iron, Silver, and Salt to create a style guide to flesh out their young brand. They provided me with a logo they had already had made, and a font that came with it.</p>
      <img src="graphics/iron_silver_salt.jpg" alt="Iron Silver and Salt's logo." class="ISSVDLogo">
      <p>From that, I selected a complimentary font to accompany their brand font, determined an appropriate color palette, and fleshed out a style guide for them.</p>

          <li>Find and listen to the werewolf episode.</li>

          <li>Find where else the podcast is available.</li>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Iron, Silver, and Salt was a very fun site to design. This opportunity taught me a lot about balancing the needs of a client with the needs of your superiors, while still keeping the focus of the designs on the users. Getting and incorporating feedback is always an important process of creating something new, but growing the ability to balance feedback from different stakeholders is an essential piece of that.</p>
      <p>Moving forward, as the podcast grows, I would like to add pages to the site- a merch store if they create some, or pages dedicated to any books or videos they create. Creating additional monster info cards, and episode pages would be a good addition as well, if there were more time.</p>
