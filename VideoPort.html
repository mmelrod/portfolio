            <p>This is a 3.5 minute video highlighting all the women who decided to participate in Combat Archery Boston's Women's Day Tournament, hosted by Archery Games Boston. The main challenges in creating this video stemmed from meeting the goals set for it:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Create a compelling video using the available footage.</li>
              <li>Balance the clips used so that no participant felt more or less highlighted.</li>
              <li>Balance the clips used so that no participant felt picked on.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Because of the unscripted nature of the tournament, I had to analyze the footage after the tournament concluded to select clips to use throughout. To accomplish this, I recorded timestamps of highlitable moments, what happened during the clip, who was being highlighted, and who was seen getting hit by an arrow.</p>
            <img src="graphics/wt_highlight_clips.png" alt="spreadsheet for clip tracking" class="DiscoveryImage">
            <p>As I edited the video together, I also used this spreadsheet to keep track of where in my video's timeline each clip was, which clips were being augmented with slo-mo footage, and which clips required extra effects that prevented the slo-mo footage from being used alongside them. Since the video was meant to be a celebration of the tournament, the spreadsheet also helped me ensure that no player was seen getting hit in multiple clips in a row, preventing players feeling like their mistakes were being highlighted.</p>

            <p>To accompany the written instructions for their new mass spectrometer, Agilent wanted a series of instructional videos that would increase the accessibility of the manual. Planning for the filming sessions was extensive, creating lists of videos that were needed, shot lists for each video, and then cross-referencing each shot list to find shots that would be reusable across multiple videos.</p>
            <section class="ProjectSplitContent">
              <section class="ProjectLeft">
                <p>Further restricting the filming schedule was the need to also take photographs of the instrument. To ensure each of these photographs were taken, another shot list was needed. This list also had to be compared to the shot list for the videos, so that photographs could be taken without redoing the work necessary to expose certain components.</p>

            <p>Ultimately, I produced roughly 40 instructional videos for the 5977B Operating Manual. The videos were completed in time for inclusion with the 5977B's scheduled release date, samples of which can be viewed at the link below.</p>

            <p>To create these videos, my team and I start with recording timestamps in each match's replay for potential highlightable moments. I then select the clips from these lists to be featured using the following criteria:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Every team gets featured in every video.</li>
              <li>The total length of the video should be as close to 1 minute as possible.</li>
              <li>A given player shouldn't be featured in a given video more than once.</li>
              <li>Each player should be featured at least once per season.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once the clips are selected, I edit the footage so that each clip has a clear subject and followable action. After rendering each video out, I rewatch it for another quality check before forwarding the completed video to the teammate who handles the video uploads.</p>

            <h2>Agilent OpenLab</h2>
            <p>These are a series of training videos I created to accompany Agilent's OpenLab software. The first step to creating them was to communicate with Agilent SMEs to discuss what procedures were Agilent's highest priority due to their complexity, frequency, and/or marketability. Once I had a list of videos, I researched the procedures necessary in preparation for performing and recording the actions myself. Then, Once I had all of the necessary audio and video recordings, I combined everything in Adobe Premiere before sending Agilent drafts of the videos for review.</p>

            <p>One particularly challenging aspect of this project was learning how to perform the necessary actions well enough to be able to do so in multiple languages for Agilent's international audiences. However, with the assistance of the Google Translate app's live translation feature, I was able to ensure these localized videos were up to Agilent's quality standards.</p>
