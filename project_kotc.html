        <h1>Knights of the Cupboard</h1>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Knights of the Cupboard is a 1v1 card game, designed to be accessible to players of a wide variety of skill levels. I brainstormed, prototyped, playtested and refined the game throughout its development, cumulating in its release on the game crafters' storefront.</p>

          <h3>Brainstorming</h3>
          <p>The main idea of the game was to create a game where all players had to use the same deck. This constraint pushed the design towards the game revolving around one particular card in the deck; a card which would decide the game when played. This meant that each of the other cards in the deck had to support this plan, including cards that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Replaced itself with a card from the deck.</li>
            <li>Allowed the player to look at some of their opponent's cards.</li>
            <li>"Borrow" a card from their opponent's hand.</li>
            <li>Play some number of cards directly from the deck.</li>
          </ul>

            <h3>Prototyping</h3>
            <p>The first step to improving the game was to create a prototype. For this game, that involved writing out card effects on paper, and taping them to a spare deck of cards I had. These paper prototypes would be used to playtest and refine the game.</p>

        <h3>Playtesting</h3>
        <p>Playtesting the game allowed me to gather player feedback and discover some areas that needed refinement.</p><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Replace the card with a different effect to prevent scenarios where the game could not end..</li>
            <li>Make the deck size 2n+1+(card draw effects), where n was each players' hand size, to create uncertainty in endgame scenarios.</li>
            <li>Expand the deck from 19 to 27 cards to allow for an additional round of play before the deck runs out.</li>
            <li>Decrease the number of copies of each card, and increase the number of different card effects to increase the variability of games.</li>
            <li>Change "You may immediately play another card" to "On your next turn, you may play an additional card" to reduce player frustration in unexpected losses.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Card design</h3>
        <p>To design the layout of the cards, I exmained several other card games including Magic the Gathering, Yu Gi Oh, and Love Letter. I used Figma to break these cards down into their fundamental components, and examine the strengths and weaknesses of each. </p>

          <h3>Launch</h3>
          <p>Once the art was complete, the playtests were returning a lot of positive feedback, and I had found a manufacturer and distributor that I liked, I created a store page and launched Knights of the Cupboard into the world. This whole process was extremely rewarding to have progressed through, and I am looking forward to launching my next project in a similar fashion. Thank you for taking the time to have a peek at my thought process, and please do have a look at the final product at the link below.</p>
